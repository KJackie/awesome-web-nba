### This website is a daily NBA pickem pool where users can sign up and make daily NBA picks. Users can compete with eachother in the pool and be scored based on their correct picks. I also added ways for the user to view NBA highlights, scores (past, current, and upcomming) and can view betting odds. 
### This project was created because I am a fan of sports pools and wanted to recreate one using React and add some features that I though were missing from the sites I use.
