# Socklord Pick'em Pool
## Created an NBA pick'em pool website where users can make daily NBA picks and compete against others. You can also view live scores, game scoring leaders, and upcoming/previous matches.

### Register for an account to get started. There is also an option to sign in as a Guest to see how the site works without creating an account.

### Once registered, head over to the picks page and make your picks. In this image, some games are grayed out. If a game has already started, a user will not be able to pick these games.

### Once you submit your picks, a popup will appear which shows you your picks. You can choose to edit them or go to the pool. Since most games already started, 'No Pick' will show up instead of a team logo.

### The pool will show all the users picks. The picks will be highlighted either green or red depending on if their picked team has won or is winning. There is a total score which counts the number of correct picks each user has.

### The games section is where you can view current games, previous games, or upcomming games. You can choose the date you like and view the scores. The game boxes can be expanded like in the image below, and will show the box score and the scoring leaders for that game.
